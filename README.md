## Description

Code Quiz is a quiz to test basic knowelge of coding.  Scores
are determined by how much time you have at the end of the quiz.  For each incorrect answer, 10 points/seconds are deducted.  If you score points, feel free to enter your score with your initials, and it will be stored in your computer unless you decide to clear the high scores.

## Accomplishment 

In addition to deploying a successful code quiz, multiple timer delays were added to enhance the user's experience.  The display of whether the user has gotten the question right or wrong disappears after 1.2 seconds, for example.
